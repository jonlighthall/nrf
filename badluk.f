do 12 iyyy=iybeg,iyend Loop over each year,
do 11 im=1,12 and each month.
jday=julday(im,13,iyyy) Is the 13th a Friday?
idwk=mod(jday+1,7)
if(idwk.eq.5) then
n=12.37*(iyyy-1900+(im-0.5)/12.)
This value n is a rst approximation to how many full moons have occurred
since 1900. We will feed it into the phase routine and adjust it up or down until
